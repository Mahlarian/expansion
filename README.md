# Expansion
> You are currently viewing the 1.16 release version of Expansion. For future versions, please visit the other branches on this repository. 

Expansion is a Minecraft datapack developed by Mahlarian aiming to change the experience of survival Minecraft. In this new mode, resource management and speed will be key, as you will have to prioritize whether you use your resources to expand your playing area or to make better equipment for yourself. 

## How to play
The Expansion experience starts as soon as you start up a new world, with your starting area being only 64x64 blocks, and with a timer that counts down when you start. Everytime the timer hits 0, your area shrinks, and the timer will be reset. Your goal is to collect resources to craft new Expansion Cores, allowing you to explore more playing area. With such a small area to start, you will have to be creative in how you handle the new challenges that come. For more in-depth information, use the Expansion manual after starting the gamemode.

## Configuring
Expansion comes with several difficulties to match players of different skill levels and the amount of players you play with. When joining a world with Expansion installed and not started, you will receive a prompt letting you know the gamemode is not active, and that you can start it using the **Config Book**. To obtain the book, either click the highlighted button text in-game, or run the command `/function expansion:give_book`. 

When in config mode, you will be held in place and frozen from interacting with the world. Using your hotbar, you will see multiple items. Drop the items in your hotbar in order to navigate the menu. 

### Difficulty
The difficulty modifies how quickly the border shrinks, how many blocks it will shrink, how many blocks the cores will add, and additional side effects of using cores. You can view the effects of a difficulty by hovering over its respective item in your inventory.
### Game modifiers
Modifiers are effects that alter how Expansion behaves, which may add additional challenge or change the gameplay experience for replayability. 

## Active Beta
Currently, Expansion is in beta, meaning some features may be incomplete and you may experience bugs while playing. Testing is greatly appreciated during this period to ensure a fun and balanced experience! 
**Note**: The 1.16 release of Expansion will be dropped in favor of 1.17, and will not include new features after release.

**Planned Changes for future versions**:
---
- New permission system that allows for non-op players to interact with Expansion UI's and configuration mode. Customizable for server admins
- More game modifiers for more replayability
- New endgame Expansion objectives such as bosses
- Overhaul crafting system
